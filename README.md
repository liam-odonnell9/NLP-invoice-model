# NLP-invoice-model
Created invoice NLP model using NLTK and TfidfVectorizer

**Description:**
Every month, my project recieves a large number of invoices. Our business team spends countless hours going through each invoice to categorize these expenses and share with stakeholders how much money is being charged to each category. For one particular company (SOS), I built a NLP model that successfully catorgorized 100% of their expenses over the last 7 months. For confidetiality purposes, the .csv file used to train the data and the results of the project cannot be shown. However, the below code shows the process of building the model.
